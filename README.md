# Count-Next-Element

>08 June 2021 11:31 PM

So the first way I did this question was the super beginner method but of course that exceeds the time limit for bigger cases. Anyway so this new method uses a hash table - I tried doing it with a Counter which technically should work but it isn't - I don't know why. If I ever find out I'll update it here.

But here I've used ``.get()`` that is used for dictionaries (hash tables) in python. 

``The get() method returns the value for the specified key if key is in dictionary.``

I'm not really sure what the + 1 is doing there ðŸ™‚

I just wanna sleep today tbh
